###### Welcome to merle-pwd.

    -

merle-pwd will be a password manager to create and organize all of your passwords - for free.
It's public domain. Forever. It will work on every device you've. merle-pwd will sync your
passwords, if you want with your self hosted on your server. 

**Disclaimer: Here's nothing for a productive use case at the moment.**

**What works**
- Password creation (in a basic way)
- Storing into a file
    - Dictonary: Timecode, User, Site, Password
    
**What should work**
- GUI
- Password creation only with ASCII/digits e.g.
- How to: create a secure password
- Remember to change an old password
- 2FA 
- Login into merle-pwd with Master Password and/or 2FA-Key, Fingerprint
- App: Android, iOS
- Desktop: macOS, Linux, Windows
- Salt Hash Keys

**Important**
- Anyone has to take care, that the keys and files are safe. I can't do that. 
- This is a "how to learn coding with python". I tried it several times and I failed every single
time. So I try it this way, perhaps it will work.
